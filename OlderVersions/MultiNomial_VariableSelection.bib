We consider a carefully devised shrinkage prior on the matrix of regression coefficients which obviates the need to specify a prior on the rank, and shrinks the regression matrix towards low-rank and row-sparse structures. We provide theoretical support to the proposed methodology by proving minimax optimality of the posterior mean under the prediction risk in ultra-high dimensional settings where the number of predictors can grow sub-exponentially relative to the sample size. A one-step post-processing scheme induced by group lasso penalties on the rows of the estimated coefficient matrix is proposed for variable selection, with default choices of tuning parameters. We additionally provide an estimate of the rank using a novel optimization function achieving dimension reduction in the covariate space. We exhibit the performance of the proposed methodology in an extensive simulation study and a real data example.},

  title       = {Targeted Random Projection for Prediction from High-Dimensional Features},
  abstract    = {We consider the problem of computationally-efficient prediction from high dimensional and highly correlated predictors in challenging settings where accurate variable selection is effectively impossible. Direct application of penalization or Bayesian methods implemented with Markov chain Monte Carlo can be computationally daunting and unstable. Hence, some type of dimensionality reduction prior to statistical analysis is in order. Common solutions include application of screening algorithms to reduce the regressors, or dimension reduction using projections of the design matrix. The former approach can be highly sensitive to threshold choice in finite samples, while the later can have poor performance in very high-dimensional settings. We propose a TArgeted Random Projection (TARP) approach that combines positive aspects of both strategies to boost performance. In particular, we propose to use information from independent screening to order the inclusion probabilities of the features in the projection matrix used for dimension reduction, leading to data-informed sparsity. We provide theoretical support for a Bayesian predictive algorithm based on TARP, including both statistical and computational complexity guarantees. Examples for simulated and real data applications illustrate gains relative to a variety of competitors.},

In univariate Bayesian linear regression with a single response y, shrinkage priors which can be expressed as scale mixtures of normal densities are popular for obtaining sparse estimates of the coefficients. In this paper, we extend the use of these priors to the multivariate case to estimate a p×q coefficients matrix B. We derive sufficient conditions for posterior consistency under the Bayesian multivariate linear regression framework and prove that our method achieves posterior consistency even when p>n and even when p grows at nearly exponential rate with the sample size. We derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm and provide the implementation in a comprehensive R package called MBSP. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations and data analysis that our model has excellent finite sample performance.},

The low-rank structure in the coefficient matrix is of intrinsic multivariate nature, which, when combined with sparsity, can further lift dimension reduction, conduct variable selection, and facilitate model interpretation. Using a Bayesian approach, we develop a unified sparse and low-rank multivariate regression method to both estimate the coefficient matrix and obtain its credible region for making inference. The newly developed sparse and low-rank prior for the coefficient matrix enables rank reduction, predictor selection and response selection simultaneously. We utilize the marginal likelihood to determine the regularization hyperparameter, so our method maximizes its posterior probability given the data. For theoretical aspect, the posterior consistency is established to discuss an asymptotic behavior of the proposed method. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated via simulation studies and a real application on yeast cell cycle data.},
